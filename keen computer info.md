# MY PASSION
<p> <i> My passion for writing is something words are not able to explain. It is like an addiction to something that you have no control over. Whether I have to write or type, my love for it takes me to another place. Writing is much more than an assignment with a due date or necessity. It does not matter if I am required to type an essay or simply feel the need to write a poem. I could write about anything in the world. </p>
