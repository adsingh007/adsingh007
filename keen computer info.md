# MY PASSION
<p> <i> My quality is my passion for cooking. Most people wonâ€™t consider cooking as a quality but for me it is. Ever since a child, watching my mother cook gave me aspirations to pursue a career as a chef. With the effort she puts in, her food always turn out delicious and people become content. </p>
</br>
<p> <i>I came to experience my passion of cooking in an unexpected situation. As a fifth grader, I always came home hungry. The cabinets in my kitchen would be filled with snacks that were easily to make.. One day, I was unlucky to find food and tried cooking on the stove. I made fried rice with soy sauce. I was afraid to burn them but they turned out ok at the end.

I was relieved that I successfully managed a stove since it was my first time using it. During that day, my mom noticed rice near the stove. She asked me if I cooked. I said yes.</p>
